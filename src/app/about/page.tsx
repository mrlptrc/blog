          Hey! I’m Murilo 20 years old, born and raised in the southern outskirts of São Paulo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by tech. While others were just playing games, I was trying to figure out how they worked under the hood. That curiosity led me to discover programming through an old Minecraft mod.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything clicked when I built my first real project with friends. I realized how much I loved problem-solving, how fast I could learn, and how my communication helped the team move forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I chose to study Systems Analysis and Development a more direct path to what I love. Over time, I shaped my profile: curious, focused, and driven to turn ideas into real things.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first job was at a consultancy and also my first ever job. There, I led a major refactor of a complex process, integrated automation for public IPTU data, and delivered everything with performance and precision under a tight deadline. It was a turning point.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, I work as a freelancer, contribute to open source, and build personal projects. I mostly code in JavaScript and Java, but I’m diving deeper into architecture, backend, security, performance and databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Want to talk tech, build something together, or just rant about bad UI? I’m all ears.
